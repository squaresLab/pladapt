	Dart Utility Function
	Dart Adaptation Manager
		- Not a true adaptation manager, simply switches between the various
			adaptation managers defined in the main project. They are model agnostic
			because DART is built on the generic model framework in the main project
	

Environment
	Semantics and Coordination
		Random Seed
			- Provides consistent randomness throughout the simulation based on the 
				initial random seed
		Real Environment
			- Stores the locations of the targets
		Environment Monitor
			- Handles "observing" up to a horizon with a nondeterministic behaviour.
			- Gives the probablity of a target? being in the location
			- Based on observations, not the simple probability of there being a target
				for a generic square
