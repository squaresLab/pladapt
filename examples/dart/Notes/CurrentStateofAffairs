The code is made in 3 levels:
  -PLADAPT Framework: Gives the generic framework for instantiating an environement and configuration
  -DART: A specific instantiation of the framework for the drone missions
  -Main/Simulation: 
    - Provides the command line interface for DART
    - Glues the pieces together in a Sim loop

Currently when implementing the PlanDB structure it was necessary to violate the PLADAPT/DART separation.
The Hybrid adaptation manager was implemented on the DART side. To accomodate the extra functionality,
I added to the PRISMWrapper to allow for Plan files to just be generated and deleted at a different time.
I still preserved the functionality of the PMC adaptation manager.

There are a couple places where I put TODO or QUESTION comments with the #drew tag. These are places where
I ran into assumptions/design decisions that could come up later. Most should be fine, but they are
useful to have marked.
